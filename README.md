KaggleCompetition-SentimentalAnalysis-MovieReviews
This repository contains my solution and code for the [SentimentalAnalysis MovieReviews] on Kaggle.
This Competition dataset  each record represents a movie-review pair with movie title, description, genres, duration, director, actors, users' ratings, review text, reviewer name, etc. Your task is to build an ML model to predict sentiment of the review text.

## Dataset
The competition dataset can be found [here]([link-to-kaggle-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sentiment-prediction-on-movie-reviews/data)). It includes [briefly describe key details about the dataset, e.g., the number of features and samples, data format, and target variable]

## Approach

- Data Preprocessing: [handled missing values, encoded categorical variables].
- Feature Engineering: [Feature Engineering Done using Pandas].
- Modeling: [Models Used : Logistic Regression,AdaBoost,XGBoost].
- Evaluation: [Evaluated Using accuracy SCore HyperParameter Tuning is Done].

## Results

- Final Kaggle Score:0.81482
